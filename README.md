I created this file while working through Tim Berglund seminar on Git.

It is covering things I have yet to learn, such as hash-object, cat-file -p, -t for the SHA-1 hash.

File --changes, Blob --file, Tree --file name, file mode, directory.  Git write-tree.  Porcelain commands.  Different far-back-end commands for collaborative workflows.
