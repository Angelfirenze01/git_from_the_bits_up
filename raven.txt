Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore --
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door --
Only this and nothing more."

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wish the morrow; --vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow --sorrow for the lost Lenore --
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore --
Nameless <i>here</i> for evermore.

And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me --filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;--
 This it is and nothing more."

 Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer
 "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
 But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
 And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
 That I scarce was sure I heard you" --here I opened wide the door; --
 Darkness there and nothing more.

 Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing
 Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
 But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
 And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?"
 This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!" --
 Merely this and nothing more.

 Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
 Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
 "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;
 Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore --
 Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--
 'Tis the wind and nothing more!"
